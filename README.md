i want login page for user with session (check if user is already logged in on device, else show login page/signup page. User can log in with google or enter email and password. For signup: username, email, password. We ask user to share location information, and store location in database (we update it constantly - or use an api that gives users location). After login page, we show a map around the users location with little clickable red dotts where there is an event. User can click event. It gives page with people who are part of event. and option to join (user can join if event organizer has accepted). User also has option "+" to create event: enter event location, time of arrival: when will event show up on map, and add users to event
